# PiZero USB Hub - 4 #

The PiZero Hub is a USB hub designed in the form factor of the Raspberry Pi
Zero. This Raspberry Pi Zero was created to be much smaller than the Raspberry
Pi, however some projects still require the functianlity of multiple USB ports.
This Hub uses the TUSB2046B, this device driver registers as a "Generic USB Hub"
to this effect no programming of the device is needed if you are making it
yourself.

This device is not USB compliant as there are some key features missing, this 
device does not comply with Raspberry Pi Hat standards. That being said this
device can power the Raspberry Pi and downstream USB devices.

The device can be connected to the Raspberry Pi be soldering wires between the 
USB test points and P3. Or a USB micro to USB micro cable can be used. The power
can come from the Raspberry Pi or can come from the barrel jack on the board.

*This project is licensed under the CERN OHL v1.2*
