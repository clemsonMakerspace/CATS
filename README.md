CATS
====

The Clemson (Machinery) Access Tracking System, or CATS, is a [Creative Inquiry](http://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/creative-inquiry/) project at Clemson University.

The goal of the project is to come up with an open-source system that can track and control machine access
at the Makerspaces on the campus.  As we work on the design process, we document our progress in our blog,
which you can find [here](http://ci.clemson.edu/blogs/cats/)
