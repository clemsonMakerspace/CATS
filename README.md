# CATS
Clemson (Machinery) Access Tracking System, or CATS, is part of a Creative Inquiry at Clemson University.  The goal of the project is to come up with an open-source system that can track and control machine access at the Makerspaces on the campus.  As we work on the design process, we document our progress in our blog, which you can find [here](http://ci.clemson.edu/blogs/cats/)
